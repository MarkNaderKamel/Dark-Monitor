

Build a complete, fully functional PHP-based monitoring system . The system should monitor a list of specified forums, websites (clear web and deep web), dark web sites (via Tor if possible), and Telegram channels for new posts or updates related to leaked databases. It must use only free APIs and libraries—no paid services. Use PHP's built-in cURL for web scraping, the free Telegram Bot API for channel monitoring (guide the user to create a free bot token via BotFather), and for dark web, integrate a free Tor proxy setup (e.g., using cURL with a public Tor SOCKS proxy or a simple PHP Tor library like php-tor if installable via Composer on Replit free tier; if not, fallback to clear web mirrors where available).

The system should:
- Run periodically (e.g., every hour via a simple loop or Replit's cron-like scheduling if possible; suggest using a while loop with sleep for testing).
- Scrape or fetch content from each source, searching for keywords like "leak", "database", "dump", "credentials", "breach", or "stolen data".
- If a match is found, log the details (source, title/description, link, timestamp) to a local file (e.g., monitors.log) and optionally send a free email notification using PHP's mail() function with a free SMTP like Gmail.
- Handle errors gracefully (e.g., site down, rate limits) and respect robots.txt where applicable to avoid bans.
- Be modular: Separate functions for web scraping, Telegram polling, and dark web access.
- Include setup instructions in comments: How to get a Telegram bot token, set up environment variables on Replit for sensitive info (e.g., bot token), and run the script.
- Use free PHP libraries via Composer if needed (e.g., guzzlehttp/guzzle for better HTTP, but fallback to pure cURL if Composer limits apply on free tier).
- Ensure the entire system is free to run—no cloud costs beyond Replit free limits.

List of sources to monitor:
Forums and Clear/Deep Web Sites:
- XSS: https://xss.is (and .onion if dark web)
- LeakBase: Search for current domain (often leakbase.cc or similar; scrape main leak sections)
- Exploit.in: https://exploit.in
- BHF: https://bhf.io
- Altenen: https://altenen.nz
- Cracked: https://cracked.to or https://cracked.sh
- Nulled: https://nulled.to
- BreachForums: https://breached.vc (or current variant)
- DarkForums: https://darkforums.st
- RAMP: Search via Tor for current .onion (no public clear domain)
- FreeHacks: Search for current domain
- Sinister: Search for current domain
- Cracking: Search for current domain
- Ransomware.live: https://ransomware.live (aggregate leak sites)

Dark Web Sites (use Tor proxy for .onion addresses; fetch via cURL with SOCKS5 proxy like 127.0.0.1:9050 if user runs Tor locally or via a free service):
- Dread: dread* [dot] onion (search on Ahmia.fi for current)
- CryptBB: cryptbb* [dot] onion
- Hydra Market: hydra* [dot] onion
- Autoshop Marketplaces: e.g., briansclub* [dot] onion, bidencash* [dot] onion, russianmarket* [dot] onion

Telegram Channels (use Telegram Bot API to poll for updates; bot must join channels):
- Moon Cloud / Moon Cloud | Free Logs: @mooncloudlogs (or search by name)
- Observer Cloud: @observercloud

- Canada Union: @canadaunion
- Qianxun 🇯🇵 Japan Company — Direct Buy/Receiving: @qianxunjapan
- Genius Qi Jiusi — Japan Real-Time Phishing (Service): @geniusqijiusi
- Hacktivist channels: @noname05716, @rippersec, @darkstormteam, @zpentestalliance

Output the full PHP code with comments, a main script (e.g., monitor.php), and any helper files. Make it easy to run on Replit by uploading to a new PHP repl and running via 'php monitor.php'.
